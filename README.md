# Quantum Chronicles v1.0.0

**An Interactive Narrative Experience** powered by the **Quantum Narrative Convergence Engine (QNCE)**.

---

## Welcome to Quantum Chronicles

Quantum Chronicles is an immersive interactive novel where every choice creates ripples through the narrative universe. Using quantum-inspired storytelling principles, your decisions don't just change the storyâ€”they fundamentally alter the fabric of reality itself.

## What is QNCE?
QNCE is a revolutionary narrative engine inspired by quantum mechanics concepts:
- **Superposition:** Multiple narrative possibilities exist simultaneously until choice collapse occurs.
- **Collapse:** Player choices "collapse" quantum possibilities into concrete narrative paths.
- **Entanglement:** Early decisions create invisible connections that influence future story branches.
- **Variable Dynamics:** Four core dimensions (Curiosity, Coherence, Disruption, Synchrony) evolve with each choice.

---

## Interactive Experience
- **Immersive Narrative**: Experience a story that adapts to your quantum choices.
- **Variable Dashboard**: Watch your decisions affect Curiosity, Coherence, Disruption, and Synchrony in real-time.
- **Quantum Feedback**: Observe how choices create narrative convergence or disruption.
- **Multiple Paths**: Explore different quantum storylines with each playthrough.

## Core Technology
- **useQNCE**: Advanced React hook managing quantum narrative state and variable dynamics.
- **NarrativeDisplay**: Immersive story presentation with smooth transitions.
- **ChoiceSelector**: Interactive decision interface for quantum choice selection.
- **VariableDashboard**: Real-time display of narrative quantum variables.
- **Quantum Feedback System**: Visual indicators of narrative state changes.

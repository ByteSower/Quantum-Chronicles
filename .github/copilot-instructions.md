# Copilot Instructions for Quantum Chronicles

This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript interactive novel powered by the Quantum Narrative Convergence Engine (QNCE).

## QNCE Concepts
- **Superposition:** Multiple narrative outcomes exist until a choice is made.
- **Collapse:** Choices "collapse" the narrative to a specific path, updating state and variables.
- **Entanglement:** Early decisions affect later outcomes, enabling complex, interconnected stories.
- **Variable Dynamics:** Four core dimensions (Curiosity, Coherence, Disruption, Synchrony) evolve with player choices.

## Component Responsibilities
- **useQNCE:** Manages narrative state, node transitions, flag updates, and variable dynamics.
- **NarrativeDisplay:** Renders the current narrative text with immersive transitions.
- **ChoiceSelector:** Displays available choices as accessible, responsive buttons.
- **VariableDashboard:** Real-time display of quantum narrative variables with visual feedback.
- **StateDebugOverlay:** Developer-only overlay showing current node, flags, and history.
- **StoryFlow:** Orchestrates the complete narrative experience and component integration.

## Design Philosophy
- **Immersive Experience:** Dark, moody theme with quantum-inspired gradient accents.
- **Interactive Novel Focus:** Prioritize story immersion over technical demonstration.
- **Quantum Visualization:** Make abstract narrative concepts tangible through UI.

## Usage & Development Guidelines
- Use idiomatic React and TypeScript.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling with dark theme and indigo/purple/cyan accents.
- Organize code in `/src` by feature, not by type.
- Prioritize immersive storytelling experience over technical exposition.
- All narrative logic should be encapsulated in hooks or context.
- Document all QNCE-specific logic and data models clearly.
- Version: v1.0.0

## How to Run & Test
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Experience the quantum narrative, track variables, and explore different story paths.

## Contributing
- Suggest narrative enhancements, new story branches, or quantum mechanics improvements.
- Test narrative paths and variable logic for narrative coherence.
- Follow the above conventions for code and documentation.

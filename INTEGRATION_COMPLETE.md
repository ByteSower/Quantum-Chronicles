- **Well-documented configuration** files
- **Modular tutorial step system** for easy content updates
- **Debug overlays** maintained for development

## ðŸš€ Current Status

### Build & Deployment
- âœ… **Local development server** running on `http://localhost:5175/Quantum-Chronicles/`
- âœ… **Zero build errors** in TypeScript compilation
- âœ… **All dependencies** properly installed and updated
- âœ… **Git history** clean with proper commit messages
- âœ… **Remote branches** synchronized with latest changes

### Branch Status

- `feature/tutorial-enhancement`: Merged âœ…
- `main`: Stable v1.2.1 (will be updated in next release)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### Immediate Testing (Recommended)
1. **User acceptance testing** of the integrated SideMenu
2. **Tutorial flow validation** - ensure all steps work correctly
3. **Cross-browser testing** for compatibility
4. **Mobile responsiveness** verification
5. **Accessibility audit** with screen readers

### Feature Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Tutorial content refinement** based on user feedback
2. **Analytics dashboard** to monitor tutorial engagement
3. **A/B testing** of tutorial effectiveness
4. **Additional SideMenu options** (e.g., themes, help)
5. **User preferences** persistence across sessions

### Production Readiness
1. **Performance benchmarking** of the integrated app
2. **SEO optimization** for the tutorial content
3. **Error boundary implementation** for graceful failures
4. **Progressive Web App** features consideration
5. **GitHub Pages deployment** of the develop branch

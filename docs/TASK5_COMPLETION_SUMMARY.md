## ðŸ“Š Key Beta Features Ready for Testing

### Feedback Collection Points
1. **Post-Onboarding**: "How was getting started?" (immediate)
2. **First Choice**: "How was making your first choice?" (3s delay)
3. **Story Midpoint**: "How are you enjoying the story?" (4s delay at 5th choice)
4. **Deep Engagement**: "How is your quantum journey going?" (5s delay at 10th choice)
5. **Variable Dashboard**: "How useful are the variable displays?" (2s delay on interaction)
6. **Session End**: "How was your overall experience?" (on page unload after 2+ minutes)
7. **Story Complete**: "Congratulations on completing the story!" (immediate)

### A/B Test Variants
- **Variant A (Control)**: Minimal onboarding, clean narrative experience
- **Variant B (Treatment)**: Enhanced onboarding with guided tour, engagement prompts

### Analytics Events Tracked
- All user interactions (choices, dashboard usage, feedback responses)
- Onboarding flow completion/abandonment
- Session duration and engagement patterns
- Feedback response rates and sentiment
- Error rates and performance metrics

## ðŸš€ Beta Deployment Ready

### Build Status
- **Environment**: Beta isolated configuration
- **Version**: 0.3.0-beta.1
- **Build Size**: 464KB (18 files)
- **All Tests**: Passing (type-check, lint, build)

### Monitoring Configuration
- **Analytics Isolation**: Beta endpoints configured to prevent production data contamination
- **Success Metrics**: >50% onboarding completion, >15% feedback response rate, >5min session duration
- **Error Thresholds**: <2% error rate, <5% critical issues

### Next Steps for Beta Launch
1. **Deploy** dist/ contents to beta staging environment
2. **Verify** analytics endpoints are receiving test data
3. **Recruit** 20-30 beta testers using provided testing guide
4. **Monitor** key metrics daily using monitoring dashboard
5. **Collect** feedback for 2-3 weeks
6. **Analyze** data and iterate based on user feedback
7. **Prepare** production launch with optimized configuration

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria Established

### Primary Goals (Must Achieve)

# Quantum Chronicles Beta Testing Guide

## 🎯 Beta Testing Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Validate feedback collection system** at key narrative milestones
- **Test A/B variants** for onboarding and micro-prompts effectiveness  
- **Collect real user data** on engagement patterns and user preferences
- **Identify usability issues** before public launch

### Secondary Goals
- **Stress test analytics pipeline** with real user load
- **Validate accessibility features** across different user needs
- **Test cross-browser compatibility** and mobile responsiveness
- **Gather qualitative feedback** on story and interaction design

## 🧪 Active A/B Tests

### Test 1: Enhanced Onboarding
- **Variant A (Control)**: Minimal onboarding, jump straight to story
- **Variant B (Treatment)**: Guided onboarding with tutorial overlay
- **Hypothesis**: Enhanced onboarding improves completion rates but may reduce engagement
- **Key Metrics**: Completion rate, time to first choice, user sentiment

### Test 2: Micro Prompts
- **Status**: **DISABLED** for initial beta to reduce popup fatigue
- **Variant A (Control)**: Clean narrative experience without prompts
- **Variant B (Treatment)**: Currently same as control - scroll-based engagement prompts disabled
- **Hypothesis**: Clean experience first, will re-enable based on feedback metrics
- **Key Metrics**: Session duration, choice engagement, user satisfaction without interruption

## 📋 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Onboarding
**Objective**: Test the complete new user experience
1. Open app in incognito/private browsing mode
2. Complete (or skip) onboarding flow
3. Make first story choice
4. Continue to at least 3-5 choices
5. Check variable dashboard if available
6. Note all feedback prompts and respond to at least one

**Expected Feedback Prompts**: 
- After onboarding completion/skip
- After first choice (3-second delay)
- After 5th choice (story midpoint)

### Scenario 2: Extended Engagement Session
**Objective**: Test longer session feedback and engagement patterns
1. Continue from Scenario 1 or start new session
2. Make 10+ choices across different story paths
3. Interact with variable dashboard multiple times
4. Continue engagement for at least 20-30 minutes
5. Focus on narrative flow without interruption

**Expected Feedback Prompts**:
- Variable dashboard interaction (2-second delay)
- Story engagement feedback (after 10th choice)
- Session end feedback (when closing/leaving)

### Scenario 3: Cross-Device Testing
**Objective**: Validate mobile and desktop experiences
1. Test same scenarios across devices:
   - Desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Mobile browser (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
   - Tablet (if available)
2. Note any responsive design issues
3. Test accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader if possible)

### Scenario 4: Return User Experience
**Objective**: Test user retention and return experience
1. Complete initial session (Scenario 1)
2. Return 24+ hours later
3. Continue story from where left off
4. Note if previous feedback data persists
5. Test if feedback prompts respect cooldown periods

## 🔍 What to Look For

### User Experience Issues
- **Confusing navigation**: Users can't find expected features
- **Overwhelming feedback prompts**: Too frequent or poorly timed
- **Mobile usability problems**: Touch targets, scrolling, text size
- **Loading performance**: Slow component loading or lag

### A/B Test Observations
- **Onboarding completion behavior**: Which variant feels more natural?
- **Clean narrative experience**: How does uninterrupted story flow feel?
- **Feedback response patterns**: Are fewer prompts more effective?
- **Story progression**: Does clean experience improve story engagement?

### Analytics and Data Collection
- **Feedback prompt timing**: Do prompts appear at expected moments?
- **Response submission success**: Do feedback responses seem to save properly?
- **Console errors**: Any JavaScript errors in browser console?
- **Event tracking**: Check browser dev tools for analytics event firing

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Keyboard navigation**: Can entire app be used without mouse?
- **Screen reader compatibility**: Do elements have proper labels?
- **Focus indicators**: Clear visual focus states throughout interface?
- **Color contrast**: Readable text across all interface elements?
